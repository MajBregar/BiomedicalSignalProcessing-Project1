# BiomedicalSignalProcessing-Project1
Processing of ECG signals.


# Algorithm possible improvements and evaluation if it helps


## good improvements
* refractory period - MASSIVE +P improvement
* better differentiator - SMALL Se improvement

## rejected
* amplitude normalization (rolling z score) - not good so far
* classifier adaptability - not good so far
* smoothing differentiated signal - nope
* double threshold - not good so far


## try
* slope information - 
* peak width information (reject wide noised) -
