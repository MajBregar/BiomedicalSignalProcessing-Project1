Processing of ECG signals.


# Algorithm possible improvements and evaluation if it helps


## good improvements
* better differentiator - SMALL Se improvement

* refractory period - MASSIVE +P improvement
* better PT threshold - PT algo thresholding instead of current Massive Se improvement
* changing PT threshold coef - allows for selection between Se and +P tradeoff
